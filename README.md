* Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort their to-do list based on criteria such as priority, due date, or completion status.
* Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed to track their progress.
* Data Persistence: Ensure that to-do lists are saved in a database so that users can access them even after logging out and logging back in.
* Responsive Design: Make the web app responsive so that users can access and manage their to-do lists from various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.
* Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to provide feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or failed operations.
* Confirmation Modals: Use confirmation modals for critical actions like deleting tasks to prevent accidental data loss.

* Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific tasks within their to-do list by title, description, or other criteria.
